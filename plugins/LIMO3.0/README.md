# LInear MOdeling of MEEG data

The LInear MOdelling of MEEG data (LIMO MEEG) toolbox is a Matlab toolbox dedicated to the statistical analysis of MEEG data. It has some  interfacing with EEGLAB (in particular the STUDY in the EEGLAB develop version) to act as a plug in. However, once data are imported all is performed within LIMO MEEG and the toolbox can thus work for any data sets.

This repo is the stable version of LIMO MEEG (v3) to be used with EEGLAB (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) but can be used with in other applications like FieldTrip (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) or BrainStorm (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/) for your research applications. The previous version (1.5) is now archived here: http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2190. A quick overview is available from the website.

## Installation

Have EEGLAB installed (because we call some functions) and LIMO in the plug-in directory.

## Documentation
The [wiki](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_eeg/wiki) provides ducumentation on the various tools available and files created.
We also have a full [tutorial](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/wiki) taking you through an analysis.

## LIMO tutorial dataset

With the software we released a dataset that can now be cited and downloaded here: http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2189. The tutorial uses data prepared using [EEG-BIDS](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0104-8) avaialble here: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002718/versions/1.0.2
